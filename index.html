  <p>Hi, my name is Jason Jagosh. I love to <b>create & entertain</b>. I currently work as a freelance writer, graphic artist, audio-visual producer, and concert promoter in Tampa, FL. I enjoy <b>making people happy</b>, good music, <b>maintaining a balanced life</b>,
    understanding the universe around us, and cats.</p>
  <p>Since I have a passion to make cool stuff and a knack for computers, it was only a matter of time before I got into coding. With advances in modern computing technology, I have gained a burning desire to learn what makes the Internet click how people
    from all over the world can connect in <b>seemingly infinite</b> ways.

  <h2>Where I'm From</h2>
  <p>I was born in and grew up in Bradenton, FL. I spent a lot of my time outside on the beach, in a swimming pool, or climbing every tree in my backyard. When it would get too hot outside I would come in and play my Nintendo 64 or make cool art on the computer.</p>
  <p>I graduated from the University of South Florida in 2013 with degrees in marketing and management. I want take what I've learned from business school and focus on online marketing.</p>
